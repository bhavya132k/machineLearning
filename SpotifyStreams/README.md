Project Introduction: "Spotify Streams - Predicting Popular Songs (2023)"

The "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023" dataset offers a captivating glimpse into the musical preferences of users on the world's foremost streaming platform. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of song features, and our primary objective for this project is to predict the number of streams each song has received, leveraging the rich set of data attributes provided.

This project report will guide you through the pivotal steps involved in the analysis:

1. Data Preprocessing: We will meticulously preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data quality. These critical steps lay the foundation for robust predictive modeling.

2. Machine Learning Implementation: To forecast the number of streams for each song, we will build a machine learning algorithm from the ground up. This allows us to understand the inner workings of the model and customize it to suit our specific dataset and objectives.

3. Performance Evaluation: In the final section of the report, we will rigorously evaluate the model's performance. This includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and potentially the incorporation of domain-specific evaluation criteria. A successful outcome will not only predict song popularity but also provide insights into the features that drive streaming numbers.

This project stands at the intersection of data science and music, offering an intriguing exploration into the dynamics of what makes a song a streaming sensation. Join us on this journey through data preprocessing, machine learning, and data-driven insights into the hits of 2023.
